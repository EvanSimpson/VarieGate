#How can we monitor everything?

There's a large amount of data that other people and organizations are collecting about us and using to "make our lives better." Wouldn't it be nice if we could collect our own data and use it to make our own lives better?

Currently this is just a hacky chrome extension to collect a detailed browsing history and export it to a local database. Don't expect this to be user friendly for a while.
